# ðŸš¤ Shady Oaks Boat Rental Website

This is a PHP-based website I built for my grandfather's boat rental business. The site includes:

- A responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- A working reservation form that submitted requests via email (requires a PHP server)
- A photo slideshow showcasing available rentals
- Multiple style variants and real-time interactivity using JavaScript

> Note: This is a **recovered version** of the original site. Some files and styling reflect my early learning process and may not be optimized. This Business is no longer Open and the site is no longer active.
